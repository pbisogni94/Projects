In this directory you can find a simple HTML/CSS Twitter layout that I completed. 
To view this correctly, please ensure that you have downloaded all files (including the png, jpg, jpeg files) into one folder.
Then, you can simply click on the e1 html document and view it in chrome.

In this exercise I practised using simple html/css concepts such as: creating elements (spans, lists, divs, etc), creating classes and ID's to
select these elements and identify them. I then styled these elements in the css file.
