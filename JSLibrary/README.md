To access the code, please download all 3 files into one folder. Then, you can simply open up any file in a code editor. To see the project and click around, please open up the chrome HTML Doc in any chrome window.

In this folder there is a simple library exercise that I completed using vanilla javascript.
In this library, users can:
Add books and display book info.
Loan out books to patrons.
Add new patrons.
Books can be returned and are given a status of "Within Due Date" or "Overdue" using a set time.

In this project I practised working with different elements of DOM manipulation. This includes getting elements by their ID,
appending to elements, creating new text nodes, changing their text, etc. I also worked with event listeners, and used setTimeouts.
